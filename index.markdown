The beauty about Nosara is that it’s a smaller beach community in the heart of a nature preserve where people are friendly and life is peaceful. Iguanas and howler monkeys live in the canopy above the house. The surf is consistent and great for beginner and seasoned surfers. A car isn’t necessary as everything you’ll need is within walking distance. For further distances bicycles & quads can be rented as well as cars for side trips outside of Nosara. There are good restaurants, and a great organic farmer’s market on Saturday mornings most of the year.

For rejuvenation, massage, cleanses, rebalancing, bodywork training & yoga are available.

If you are a movie enthusiast the Frogpad has a great selection of movies including foreign & documentaries so you may want to bring your portable DVD player or computer.

Situated just a 3 minute walk from fabulous surf at Guiones Beach, and also a 2-3 minute walk to the mini market, internet, surf shop & restaurants. Being off the main road you will enjoy privacy in our backyard surrounded by lush foliage.

It took 3 years of lovingingly handcrafting this home away from home in the heart of Nosara. It is humble, soulful, and warm. We hope you enjoy your stay.
